# Micro-structural-MRI-Mapping
The aim of this project is to analyze multi-contrast placental diffusion MRI scans acquired during pregnancy and fit micro-structural models to the data to reflect the tissue com-position of the placenta.


# Introduction

The placenta is an important vascular organ of the biolog-ical system and is also the most poorly understood organ(Burton & Fowden., 2015). It provides a vital link betweenthe fetus and the mother during pregnancy and is responsi-ble for providing oxygen and nutrients to the baby growinginside and can also remove waste products from the fetalblood.  An essential organ like this can be susceptible tomultiple complications during pregnancy like Fetal GrowthRestriction (FGR) (Brosens, 2011 Mar) usually leading topre-term birth or still birth, Pre-eclampsia (PE) (Bell, 2010). PE affects 3â€“5% of pregnancies and a late onset FGR affects5-10% of pregnancies (Naljayan, 2013). 

# Data

The data given for this project consists of multi-contrast diffusion MRI scans of two patients. here are about 330 such scans of two patients, one healthy patient and one patient diagnosed with pre-eclampsia. Along with these MRI volume images, there are four binary masks which focuses on the two region ofinterests:
* Placenta - Healthy Mask & Pre-eclampsia1
* Placenta with Uterine Wall2- Healthy Mask & Pre-eclampsia
